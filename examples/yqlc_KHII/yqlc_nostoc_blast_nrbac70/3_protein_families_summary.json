Binds to transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), required for stable association of tmRNA with ribosomes. tmRNA and SmpB together mimic tRNA shape, replacing the anticodon stem-loop with SmpB. tmRNA is encoded by the ssrA gene; the 2 termini fold to resemble tRNA(Ala) and it encodes a 'tag peptide', a short internal open reading frame. During trans-translation Ala-aminoacylated tmRNA acts like a tRNA, entering the A-site of stalled ribosomes, displacing the stalled mRNA. The ribosome then switches to translate the ORF on the tmRNA; the nascent peptide is terminated with the 'tag peptide' encoded by the tmRNA and targeted for degradation. The ribosome is freed to recommence translation, which seems to be the essential function of trans-translation"
