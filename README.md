# GCsnap

GCsnap is a flexible tool that allows for the comparison of the genomic contexts of target protein-coding genes, integrating them with structural and functional information. Its main distinguishing feature is the interactivity of its outputs and the opportunity of linking to structural and functional information in multiple databases. Due to its general construction and flexible input formats, it is not restricted to prokaryotic genomes and can be used to compare genomic contexts across kingdom borders in a high-throughput fashion.
